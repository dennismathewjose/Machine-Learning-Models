# Machine-Learning-Models
This is a repository to learn and understand machine learning models.
<h2>MNIST DATASET</h2>
This is a collection of 60,000 data of handwritten digits(0-9) which are in different shapes and sizes.<br>This model is build using CNN and sequential model of machine learnig algorithm. Here our aim is to predict the handwritten data from this set.
